# BEDU-Data-Analysis
Derivable product of the Data Analysis bootcamp I took with BEDU during MAY-OCT 2020.

The order in which the files should be open is:
1. exploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb
2. machineLearningAlgorithm.ipynb
3. graphicResultsOfMLA.ipynb

The folder "data" contains the data used which was retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/jolasa/waves-measuring-buoys-data-mooloolaba
